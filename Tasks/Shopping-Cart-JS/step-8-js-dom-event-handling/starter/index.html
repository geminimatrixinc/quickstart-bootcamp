Task: Simple Shopping Cart Interaction with Single Item

Objective:
Learn basic DOM manipulation and event handling by creating a simple shopping cart interface that allows users to add 
a generic item to their cart and see the total price update automatically.

Task Description:
Develop a minimalistic shopping cart where users can add the same item multiple times. 
The total price should update dynamically as items are added 

Hint: 
- use document.querySelector to select elements by class name and ID.
- use event.addEventListener to attach events to elements.
- use the `innerText` property to update the total price.
