//# Task 2: Using Conditional Statements to Apply Discounts
// Objective: Learn to use switch statements to handle different cases.

// Task Description: Modify the existing script to apply different discounts based on the value of discountCode. 
// For now, manually change the discountCode in the script to see different results.

// Implement a switch statement that changes the value of totalAmount based on the discountCode.
// Handle two cases: "SAVE10" for a 10% discount and "SAVE20" for a 20% discount.

let totalAmount = 100;
let discountCode = "SAVE10"; // Try changing this to "SAVE20" or any other value

// Implement your switch statement below
