// Factory functions are functions that return objects. They can be used to create multiple instances of similar objects without using the `new` keyword or constructor functions.
// They are a simpler alternative to classes and can be more flexible in certain situations.
// Factory functions can also be used to create private variables and methods, which is not possible with classes.

// When to use Factory:
// You want more control (like adding closures)
// No this binding confusion
// You donâ€™t need inheritance
