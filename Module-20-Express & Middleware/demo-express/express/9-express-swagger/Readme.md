# The JSDoc-style comments under the /api/v1/users route describe the API’s endpoint, method (GET), and response (200 with an array of user objects).

# swagger-ui-express is used to host an interactive Swagger UI page at the /api-docs route.

Visit http://localhost:3000/api-docs in your browser, and you’ll see the interactive Swagger UI.
